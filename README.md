# Machine Learning for Humanities and Social Science


## Course Objective

Research in humanities and social science is now often conducted using data that is larger and more complex than the data for which conventional statistical approaches were designed. Examples of such data include information on large-scale individual-level consumer behavior, streams of social media content, and historical archives of government documents. On one hand, the data contains rich information to make inferences about unseen data, providing abundant opportunities for prediction/forecasting. On the other hand, the data is often so complex and high-dimensional that it is difficult to specify a theory-driven model using conventional statistical approaches. Machine learning is well-suited to deal with theses challenges as well as to make best of the opportunities, as it is capable of learning model structure, selecting variables, and producing accurate predictions. The three broad objectives in this course are that students will develop:

* An in-depth understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms that have proven most useful in the study of humanities and social science.
* Command of software tools for machine learning (R \& Python).
* Awareness regarding research objectives that are best-suited to investigation with machine learning \& practical experience in conducting research using machine learning.
